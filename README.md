# Cuesta College Central Coast Writers' Conference - Oct. 5, 2024

2024 will mark our 40th consecutive year, making it one of the longest running writers' conferences in the United States.

This github repo is being used for session/speaker submissions allowing attendees to have real-time input into the sessions being offered.

If you have an idea for a session or are a speaker and want to present at the conference, you have two options.

1. Easy: Submit your idea on our [jotform](https://form.jotform.com/240856275763062) (note all submissions will show up [here](https://github.com/selfpublish/ccwc/issues/9)).
   
2. Post it directly to the [Github Dicussion](https://github.com/selfpublish/ccwc/discussions/categories/suggestions-for-topics-speakers) board.

Each week, I'll consolidate submissions at the [CCWC40 Discussion](https://github.com/selfpublish/ccwc/discussions/categories/ccwc40) board where attendees will be invited to vote on the sessions they'd like to attend.
