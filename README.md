# Cuesta College Central Coast Writers' Conference 

## Saturday Oct. 5, 2024

2024 will mark our 40th consecutive year, making it one of the longest running writers' conferences in the United States.

This github repo is being used for session/speaker submissions allowing attendees to have real-time input into the sessions being offered.

If you have an idea for a session or are a speaker and want to present at the conference, you have two options.

1. **Easy Method**: (github account **not** required!) Submit your idea on our [jotform](https://form.jotform.com/240856275763062) (note all submissions will initallly show up as an [issue](https://github.com/selfpublish/ccwc/issues)), before I review and move them to the official list of possible sessions.
   
2. **Github Method** (preferred): (github account required) Post it directly to the [Suggestions for Topics/Speakers Discussion](https://github.com/selfpublish/ccwc/discussions/categories/suggestions-for-topics-speakers) board.

> You can find the latest updates on the conference in the [CCWC40 Discussion](https://github.com/selfpublish/ccwc/discussions/categories/ccwc40) board, and if you haven't already added yourself our mailing list, you should do so [here](http://eepurl.com/hIxxkL) - look for 'Subscribe.'
